                <p>Knowledge is power, and to gain it, one must first be able to read.<br>
                    <br>
                    As a developing professional, being updated on the recent news and developments in my field will be very important. I would have to read research articles, blogs, and other technical texts to get the information that I need. 
                    <br>
                    <br> Specialized English 1 helped me dissect, analyze, and understand the once-tedious process of reading technical texts. From knowing where to look to what to get on the text, SpecEng gave me a major lesson despite being a minor subjectâ€” one that will remain as long as I read.
                    <br>
                    <br>   I started with the class not expecting much from it. I wasn't really a fan of reading. I expected to get bored or find myself fiddling away. It's a good thing that my professor knows how to make the class engaging. I had fun with the interactive lectures and activities. The classroom felt welcoming and liberating.
                    <br>
                    <br>    Going back, Specialized English was not that hard for me. Though I struggle with any languages in general, I managed to pull myself through as I see myself as analytical and critical which really helped. I learned how to analyze texts as well as being able to do pre-reading, reading, and post-reading. 
                    <br>
                    <br>   Now, I would like to dedicate the last paragraph to our course professor, Miss Helen C. Raymundo. Though our block may not be perfect, I thank you for the patience you've shown to us. I thank you for your hard work in teaching Specialized English to TX-05. Also, despite my poor attendance record, you still showed interest in my abilities which actually improved my confidence in the class. Again, as a student from TX05, thank you.
